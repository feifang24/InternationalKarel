<h1>Chapter 3: Control Statements in Karel</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
  The technique of defining new methods—as useful as it is—does not actually enable Karel to solve any new problems. Because each method name is merely a shorthand for a specific set of commands, it is always possible to expand a program written as a series of method calls into a single main program that accomplishes the same task, although the resulting program is likely to be long and difficult to read. The commands—no matter whether they are written as a single program or broken down into a set of methods—are still executed in a fixed order that does not depend on the state of Karel’s world. Before you can solve more interesting problems, you need to discover how to write programs in which this strictly linear, step-by-step order of operations does not apply. In particular, you need to learn several new features of the Karel programming language that make it possible for Karel to examine its world and change its execution pattern accordingly.

<p>
  Statements that affect the order in which a program executes commands are called <b>control statements</b>. Control statements generally fall into the following two classes:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><i>Conditional statements</i>. Conditional statements specify that certain statements in a program should be executed only if a particular condition holds. In Karel, you specify conditional execution using an <code>if</code> statement.</li>
  <li><i>Iterative statements</i>. Iterative statements specify that certain statements in a program should be executed repeatedly, forming what programmers call a <b>loop</b>. Karel supports two different iterative statements: a for statement that is useful when you want to repeat a set of commands a predetermined number of times and a while statement that is useful when you want to repeat an operation as long as some condition holds.</li>
</ol>
